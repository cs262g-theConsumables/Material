Vision Statement
------------------------
Our Calvin College dating app helps bring together individuals on Calvin's campus who are looking for a match made in heaven. Unlike OKCupid or Match.com, our app has only Calvin students in mind. This allows for our app to find the best possible match to the profile you have created. The app will involve four main menus that allow the user to create a profile, meet new people, talk to them, and plan dates. The app will have a simple AI that pulls information from surveys about date successes to provide better alternatives for the future.

Survey: Tailored to Calvin students' interests
Dates: Suggestions on or around campus.
Local: Restrict search results to Calvin students.

N+1 Architectural Views 
------------------------
— This section provides a variety of views of the system architecture, based on what the Unified Process calls a Software Architecture Document (SAD). This semester, we'll set N=4 by including the following views:
- User View (the +1 view)
- Logical View
- Data View
- Interface View
- Deployment View
Each section should summarizes the key architectural decisions documented in that view and explain why they were made.

Supplemental Specifications 
------------------------
1. Non-functional requirements
-Only Calvin students can use the app
-Compatable on all Android devices, not IOS
-Using the app results in relationships
-A user's profile is secure and doesn't allow for fake profiles
-The app is free from charge.
-Not open source. This coould lead to tampering with results.
2. Test Suite — This test suite specifies how you will test your system and reports on how the testing went, including:
3. Unit testing of your system modules (at levels 0 and 1) (if required by the instructor)
4. System testing of your system functions (at levels 1 and 2)
5. Usability testing
